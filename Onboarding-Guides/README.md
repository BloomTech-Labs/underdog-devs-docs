## Introduction
This guide is a superficial introduction to the Bloomtech Labs experience on the Underdog Devs project. It contains
enough detail to describe various aspects of the experience, but refrains from too many specifics that are subject to
change.

If you can't find the information you are looking for here, then [reach out](#communication) and ask!

## Who to Know
- Product Manager - John Dodson
- Engineering Manager - Ryan Hamblin
- DS Manager - Robert Sharp
- UX Manager - Swapnali Thakar
- Release Manager - Paul St. Germain

Find out who the Web and DS Technical Project Managers (TPMs) are! These roles can change on a weekly basis, but can
be your best point of contact for navigating labs when you start.

## The Codebase
The project is broken up into 4 repositories, each with their own documentation:
- [Frontend](../Project-READMEs/README-FE.md) _- Web_
- [Backend](../Project-READMEs/README-BE.md) _- Web_
- [Data Science](./ds-onboarding-guide.md) _- DS_
- [Docs](./docs-onboarding-guide.md) _- All_ [Not yet created]

Follow the links for guides to the repositories that you will be working with based on your track (Web or DS).

## The Work - Jira
All work is specified and assigned using Jira.

Please remember the following while using Jira in Labs:
- YOU are responsible for assigning yourself tickets, nobody does it for you.
- Communicate with your teammates frequently. Many tickets overlap and end up sharing work. _Don't duplicate the work!_
- Make use of the comments feature, John Dotson (product manager) is almost always monitoring the Jira tickets for
questions and comments.

Further information can be found in the Canvas course.

## Communication
_**Communication is the most important part of ~~labs~~ software development**_

Get to know your fellow learners, managers, and resources! Nobody bites, and you will come to rely on each other
to understand, design, and implement the product.

You have various ways of staying in touch with each other, both synchronous and asynchronous.

### Synchronous
#### Daily Standup
Every weekday morning at 8am Pacific (11am Eastern), the Technical Project Managers (TPMs) will host a 15-30 minute
'Stand-up' meeting on Zoom. These meetings are to facilitate communication between teammates and coordinate larger
undertakings that require communication between teams.

#### Workshops and Office Hours
Workshops and Office Hours are where you will meet with your DS Manager.

Workshops are semi-structured 'Guided Projects' lead by the DS Manager and are recorded for later viewing.

Office Hours are office hours (not recorded).

#### Stakeholder and Product Review Meetings
Stakeholder meeting are hosted by the Product Manager. They are notable because of the
presence of our project's stakeholder, Jason. These meeting are where we are able to present our work, get feedback,
and discuss future work with the stakeholder and all the managers.

Product Review meetings are the same as stakeholder meetings, but without the stakeholder. 
They are frequently used in part as a Sprint Retrospective, and in part as a long-form standup with all the managers
in attendance.

### Asynchronous
#### Slack channels
The best way to communicate asynchronously is through Slack. There are currently 3 channels for the UD project:
- labs-underdog-devs
  - The main channel for communications between Lab learners and managers.
  - This is the best place to get a hold of the managers (not DMs).
- labs-underdog-devs-{a, b, c, d}
  - These are automatically grouped subsets of lab learners. Nobody seems to know what their purpose is.
- labs-underdog-devs-stakeholder
  - The asynchronous communication channel with the stakeholder. Post any questions or comments that you want to share
  the stakeholder here.

It is highly encouraged to have group DMs for other learners that you work with frequently. These aren't official, but
are invaluable and may become your most used channels.
