# UI Kit

To provide reference design materials and standardize elements across the app, we created a basic UI kit initially consisting of four pages in an updated Figma file.

The four pages are palettes (colors), typography (fonts), buttons, and grids.

### Colors / Palettes

Here's the colors / palettes page. We added six color swatches matched to the exact colors from the current UD marketing website, with one exception. The primary UD logo orange did not pass all contrast tests for accessibility, so we created a new darker shade labeled "high-contrast" that has sufficient contrast for all use cases.

We included hexadecimal color codes for easy reference, and usage information for each color specifying which use cases are appropriate based on our contrast tests for accessibility. We also included three helpful explanatory notes to add context.

#### Note on Colors for Text

Although most standard (small / body) text is expected to be black, we included usage information for both small and normal text in our descriptions to account for the case of the six colors being used for some other type of text, perhaps as section headers or page titles.
