for BL-508 I was requested to implement Multifactor Authentication for users using One Time Passwords.
While doing my research for how to implement this I discovered that upgrading our Auth0 account to include a Pro MFA Add-on.
This Pro MFA Add-n would cost $240 per month or $2640 per year.
I reported this to Paul St-Germain and Ryan Hamblin. After consulting with the share holders they advised me we've decided not to move forward with this functionality due to the cost.
I was instructed to create a pull request in the Docs Repo with my findings.
