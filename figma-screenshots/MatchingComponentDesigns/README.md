This is what the vision for the Mentor / Mentee matching (landing) component to look like

This is the modal that should pop up when the admin user clicks on the "Assign Mentor" button (or the mentee row). The admin can select the mentor via the checkbox on the left side. The relevant matching info for the mentee should be displayed at the top of the modal. We are planning on adding text on the model to let the user know if you check a box it will asign that mentor to the mentee and add a button to save changes. We haven't decide if we want to keep the button to save changes or just have it autosave when you check a box. We also want to go give more detal on what the status is on the mentee table we want the status to be a number of mentors assign to that mentee and if it is more than one its turns green if zero it stays red.
We would like to add a column for the model giving the user info on what stack that mentor is so you can assign the best fit mentor to that mentee.
